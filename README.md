# JS-Reverse-Polish-Notation-Calculator

This is a Javascript function that will evaluate expressions written in postfix notation. 

Postfix notation is often used in compiling languages and makes more sense to binary operators. 
An operation written as (3 − 4) × 5 in normal math would be written as 5 3 4 − x in postfix. It is unambiguous, while removing the parentheses off the former expression would change its result.

This function really should have no place in production, it was just a fun challenge I gave myself while learning some stuff.
